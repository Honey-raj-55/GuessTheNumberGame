Hi, there

--This is just a simple game in which you need to keep guessing a number from 1 to 20 until you win. 
--If you chose a smaller number than the random expected number, hint will be displayed : "Wrong guess, try a greater number"
--If you chose a greater number than the random expected number, hint will be displayed : "Wrong guess, try a smaller number"


--I imported random library and created this game by using python.
--The loop continues until you guess the correct number.
